  have to delete the previous version of the extension when an update is needed.
  This component will appear as "denodo-mongodb-customwrapper-5.0" in the Jar Extensions
  Management dialog in the VDP Admin Tool.
- Added write support (create, update, delete) - only for non-complex fields.
- Added delegation of ISNULL and ISNOTNULL to mongodb data source.
