MIGRATING TO VERSION 20190515 OF THE MONGODB CUSTOM WRAPPER
===========================================================

Version 20190515 of the MongoDB Custom Wrapper includes adaptations required
for making use of a new feature in VDP that allows configuration parameters
in Custom Wrappers to be separated between the Data Source and the Wrapper
(Base View) levels.

We recommend fully reading this document before taking any steps, in order to
make sure the required migration process is completely understood. We also
recommend that this migration process be always done in development/staging
servers, and only the successful results of the migration process be pushed
to production.

This new version of the MongoDB wrapper divides configuration parameters in a
way that most closely resembles the configuration of JDBC data sources and
base views:

   * MongoDB server and database connectivity parameters (host, port,
     database, credentials, SSL...) are now configured at the Data Source
     level.

   * MongoDB collection and schema specification remain at the Wrapper
     (Base View) level.

This new version should be installed into VDP in the usual way (using
Extensions -> Jar Management). Once installed, all existing base views should
continue working as before as long as no modifications are made to them.

But note that mere installation of the new version of the wrapper does not
modify the structure of the underlying metadata, and therefore no distinction
will be applied to metadata between Data Source and Wrapper parameters until
metadata is restructured by explicitly updating the existing MongoDB data
sources and base views.

# Step 1: Verifying Data Source - Base View relationships

The first step required for the migration of metadata is to verify that only
base views that connect to the same MongoDB server and database, and using
the same credentials, are actually linked to a single data source artifact in
VDP. So all base views depending on the same MongoDB VDP data source should
have a configuration that only differs in their "Collection Name" and the
specification of their schema ("Fields" / "Introspection Query"). This is a
requirement due to the new structure of the configuration parameters in the
wrapper.

Note that if this condition is not verified, making the necessary corrections
in the hierarchy of VDP artifacts would require the creation of new, segregated
data sources and the re-creation of base views associated to them. And given
these new artifacts would be registered already using the new configuration
structure if done through the graphical interface, there might be no need for
actually migrating the reorganized artifacts.

# Step 2: Migrating the Data Source metadata

Focusing therefore on the artifacts that aren't affected by any data source
segregation needs, we need to edit the Data Source first. When opening it,
we will be presented with a new empty form containing the fields for
configuring the host name, port, database name, credentials and use of SSL.
We should fill in this form with the MongoDB connection data already
present in the depending base views (which you can still see if you go
to any of those base views and click on "VQL" -- note credentials will
not be shown). Once the form is completed, press "Save".

# Step 3: Migrating the Base Views metadata

Once the MongoDB data source has been configured, we need to iterate through
all the base views depending on that data source and edit them ("Edit" ->
"Source Refresh"), making sure the new configuration form contains the correct
collection and schema data (previous values will be pre-filled) and saving the
base view by clicking "OK" on the form and then "Save" on the base view
configuration tab.

NOTE that, if any of the base views is configured to use an introspection query
(as opposed to a schema explicitly declared in the "Fields" form field), the
introspection query will run again and the base views's resulting schema could
differ from the original if the structure or types of the data contained in the
target MongoDB collection have changed in ways that still match the
introspection query.

After performing these steps, the VDP metadata corresponding to all MongoDB
data sources and base views should have the proper structure, which can be
checked at the "VQL" section of the base views, additionally checking the
"Show Dependencies" option in order to compare the base view's and data
source's metadata structures.
